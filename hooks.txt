This document describes how event hooks work in the AbuseFilter extension.

For a more comprehensive guide to hooks, navigate to your root MediaWiki
directory and read docs/hooks.txt.

== Events and parameters ==
This is a list of known events and parameters; please add to it if you're going
to add events to the AbuseFilter extension.

'AbuseFilter-builder': Allows overwriting of the builder values returned by AbuseFilter::getBuilderValues
&$realValues: Builder values

'AbuseFilter-deprecatedVariables': Allows adding deprecated variables. If a filter uses an old variable, the parser
will automatically translate it to the new one.
&$deprecatedVariables: array of deprecated variables, syntax: [ 'old_name' => 'new_name' ]

'AbuseFilter-computeVariable': Like AbuseFilter-interceptVariable but called if the requested method wasn't found.
Return true to indicate that the method is known to the hook and was computed successful.
$method: Method to generate the variable
$vars: AbuseFilterVariableHolder
$parameters: Parameters with data to compute the value
&$result: Result of the computation

'AbuseFilter-contentToString': Called when converting a Content object to a string to which
filters can be applied. If the hook function returns true, Content::getTextForSearchIndex()
will be used for non-text content.
$content: The Content object
&$text: Set this to the desired text.

'AbuseFilter-filterAction': DEPRECATED! Use AbuseFilterAlterVariables instead.
Allows overwriting of abusefilter variables in AbuseFilter::filterAction just before they're
checked against filters. Note that you may specify custom variables in a saner way using other hooks:
AbuseFilter-generateTitleVars, AbuseFilter-generateUserVars and AbuseFilter-generateStaticVars.
$vars: AbuseFilterVariableHolder with variables
$title: Title object

'AbuseFilterAlterVariables': Allows overwriting of abusefilter variables just before they're
checked against filters. Note that you may specify custom variables in a saner way using other hooks:
AbuseFilter-generateTitleVars, AbuseFilter-generateUserVars and AbuseFilter-generateStaticVars.
$vars: AbuseFilterVariableHolder with variables
$title: Title object target of the action
$user: User object performer of the action

'AbuseFilter-generateTitleVars': Allows altering the variables generated for a title
$vars: AbuseFilterVariableHolder
$title: Title object
$prefix: Variable name prefix
$RCRow: If the variables should be generated for an RC row, this is the row. False if it's for the current action being filtered.

'AbuseFilter-generateUserVars': Allows altering the variables generated for a specific user
$vars: AbuseFilterVariableHolder
$user: User object
$RCRow: If the variables should be generated for an RC row, this is the row. False if it's for the current action being filtered.

'AbuseFilter-generateStaticVars': Allows altering static variables, i.e. independent from page and user
$vars: AbuseFilterVariableHolder

'AbuseFilter-interceptVariable': Called before a variable is set in AFComputedVariable::compute to be able to set
it before the core code runs. Return false to make the function return right after.
$method: Method to generate the variable
$vars: AbuseFilterVariableHolder
$parameters: Parameters with data to compute the value
&$result: Result of the computation
